Thanks for reaching out and for the details below.

Here is a quick answer and next steps:

Key points
{chr(10).join(bullets) if bullets else "- We will share details on a short call."}

Based on what you shared, I recommend our {lead.get('segment','pro').title()} plan. 
If helpful, I can also share security documentation.

Would you like a 20 minute call this week to tailor a trial and answer questions?

Best,
Your Name
